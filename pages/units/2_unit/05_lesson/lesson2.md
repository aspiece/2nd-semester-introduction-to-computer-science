## Instructor's Notes
1. **Do Now**
   * Students experiment and learn that if they want to find out if a particular element is in a list, there is a useful tool that can save time.
2. **Lesson**
   * Go over the list `in` operation. Ask what the return value is (Boolean expression).
   * Have students practice using the `in` operation in an if statement. User this time to look over the student responses to the first part of the Do Now - identify the topics they are having problems with.
3. **Review**
   * Spend time reviewing the topics students are confused about.
   * Have students practice using lists and Boolean expressions.

## Accommodation/Differentiation 
   * This lesson may not be necessary, however this is a good opportunity to check for student understanding of lists and associated functions. 

## Quiz Option
   * There could also be a unit quiz after the game loop lesson or during the Zork project, and this lesson could be used to review for that quiz.
