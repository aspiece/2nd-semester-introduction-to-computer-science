# Lab 4.05 - Debugging Practice

## 1. Read through the following code:

```python
def my_looping_function(list): 
    for i in range(1, len(list)+1): 
        print(list[i])

basic_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
my_looping_function(basic_list)

```

## In your Notebook

### Write down any bugs that you see in the program

## 2. Read through the following code

```python
def my_nested_looping_function(a_list):
for i in range(0, len(a_list)):
  value = a_list[a]
for j in range(0, i):
value += j
print(value)

basic_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_nested_looping_function(basic_list)
```

## Cointinue in your Notebook

### Write down any bugs that you see in the program.

## 3. In your Console

Type and fix the two above programs
