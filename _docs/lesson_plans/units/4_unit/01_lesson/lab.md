# Lab 4.01 - de_vowel

## Remove the Vowels

Create a function, `de_vowel`, which will take a string as input and return a copy of that string with all the vowels removed. Otherwise, the string should be the same.

1. Create the function contract for `de_vowel`.
2. Write `de_vowel` using a for loop
3. Provide a few examples that confirm de_vowel works as expected:

    * What if the string is all vowels?
    * What if there are no vowels?
    * What if there is a mix of vowels and non-vowels and spaces?

### Example

Example of the file:

```python
# contract goes here
def de_vowel(a_string):
    # your code goes here
no_vowels = de_vowel("This sentence has no vowels")
print(no_vowels)
    # examples go here
```

Example output:

```python
>>> python3 de_vowel_lab.py
Ths sntnc hs n vwls
```

### Bonus

Use a counter (variable you define outside of a loop to keep track of a value inside a loop) to create a function `count_vowels`.

`count_vowels` takes in a string and returns an int representing the number of vowels in the string.
